        Led a team of five undergraduate students develop mathematical models that
        link within-host and between-host HIV dynamics. We did so by measuring the 
        effects HIV-specific antibodies have on viral load, and how they affect the
        probability of HIV transmission. 
          - Developed SIR models for HIV transmission
          - Programmed our models into MATLAB to obtain numerical results and create
            data visualizations.
          - Summarized our results in a published paper.
